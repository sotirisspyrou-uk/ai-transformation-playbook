# Organizational Readiness Model for AI Transformation

## Executive Summary

The Organizational Readiness Model provides a comprehensive framework for assessing, preparing, and managing an organization's human capital during AI transformation initiatives. This model addresses the critical success factor that 70% of digital transformations fail due to inadequate change management and organizational preparedness.

## The READY Framework
