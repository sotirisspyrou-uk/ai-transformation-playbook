### **S**coring and Prioritization System
**For Finance and Strategy Teams:** Quantitative risk evaluation and resource allocation optimization.

#### AI Risk Scoring Methodology
**Risk Score Formula:**

- **Impact (1-5):** Business consequence severity  
- **Exposure (1-5):** Organizational vulnerability level
- **Regulatory Multiplier (1.0-2.0):** Regulatory environment factor

**Executive Risk Prioritization:**
1. **Critical (15+ points):** Immediate C-suite attention required
2. **High (10-14 points):** Senior management oversight needed
3. **Medium (6-9 points):** Department-level management required
4. **Low (1-5 points):** Standard operational monitoring
