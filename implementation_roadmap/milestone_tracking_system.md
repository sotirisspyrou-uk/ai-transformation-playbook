2. **Maintain Executive Visibility:** Ensure C-suite engagement through regular, meaningful updates
3. **Build in Flexibility:** Allow milestone adjustment based on learning and changing conditions
4. **Celebrate Success:** Recognize achievement and build momentum through milestone celebrations

#### Operational Best Practices
1. **Automate Where Possible:** Reduce manual tracking overhead through system integration
2. **Maintain Single Source of Truth:** Ensure all stakeholders reference consistent, up-to-date information
3. **Plan for Dependencies:** Map and manage interdependencies between milestones and teams
4. **Enable Transparency:** Provide appropriate visibility to all stakeholders while maintaining security

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### Planning Pitfalls
- **Over-Engineering Milestones:** Creating too many detailed checkpoints that create overhead
- **Under-Estimating Dependencies:** Failing to account for cross-functional coordination requirements
- **Ignoring Organizational Change:** Focusing only on technical milestones while neglecting people aspects
- **Static Planning:** Creating rigid milestone plans that cannot adapt to learning and feedback

#### Execution Pitfalls
- **Status Report Theater:** Generating reports that look good but don't drive action
- **Late Risk Identification:** Waiting until problems are critical before escalating
- **Communication Gaps:** Inconsistent or infrequent stakeholder updates
- **Success Definition Drift:** Changing success criteria mid-stream without proper governance

#### Leadership Pitfalls
- **Micromanagement:** Over-controlling milestone execution instead of enabling team autonomy
- **Under-Investment in Tools:** Relying on manual processes when automation would improve effectiveness
- **Ignoring Feedback:** Dismissing input from front-line teams about milestone feasibility
- **Celebration Neglect:** Missing opportunities to build momentum through milestone achievement recognition
